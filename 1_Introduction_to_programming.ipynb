        "The popular web pioneer *Mark Anderssen* pointed out and discussed this question in an article in the New York Times in 2011. He stated that everything is fueled by software. From a business to a personal perspective we can agree that this is completely true.\n",

        "* *Could we find examples of our daily life in which software is participating somehow?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Actually, there are a lot of examples. Usually we understand software as an intangible asset (something that we cannot touch) that is present in computer applications like those we use in our laptop or mobile phones. However, there is much more at stake than the simple existence of software in our personal\n",

        "\n",
        "* *Can you think in some example?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, just taking a look around we can find cars, now smart cars that are connected to Internet and can communicate each other to collaborate, for instance to find a car parking, to control the car engine or even to see what is in the next corner. Tesla, Toyota or Continental are good examples of traditional companies that are becoming part of this new wave of smart cars. Aircrafts also contain a good number of software pieces. In our own home we can find very good examples of software-based devices such as smart TVs. Again homes on their own are now smart homes. \n",
        "\n",
        "In our cities, there is also a growing commitment by governments to create new services based on software such as touristic routes or find the best place to eat. We, ourselves, have some software inside. For instance, we use smart bracelets, t-shirts or rings. Besides we have changed a lot our behavior and activities:\n",

        "\n",
        "I guess that you all are now realizing that we have made an evolution controlled or driven by software. Traditional activities can now be made or enjoyed in a different way for instance:\n",

        "Let me ask you a new question: \n",
        "\n",
        "* *Do you think we are then living the fourth industrial revolution?*\n",
        "\n",
        "This phrase “industrial revolution” probably takes you to your foggy memories sitting in the high school in the history class.  Was not something about agriculture or steam engines? Yes, there was and, at least, two centuries ago. However, many experts  claim  that we are living the fourth industrial revolution: cyber-physical systems (this is basically a catch-all term for talking about the integration of smart, internet-connected machines and human labor). In other words, Industrial Revolution 4.0 \"is the production-side equivalent of the consumer-oriented Internet of Things, in which everyday objects from cars to thermostats to toasters will be connected to the internet.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "*\t*When we can consider a new industrial revolution is emerging?*\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not an easy question to answer but we can say that an industrial revolution comes when something happened, a technological advance, and regarding our initial assumptions, everything changes. It is pretty clear that industry 4.0 is here. All indicators suggest that we are going to dive into the age of the smart environments where objects communicates each other for our own benefit improving our workplace, home, city and daily life activities. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, this new industry cannot be understood without software so software is then: **MY PRECIOUS!**\n",
        "\n",
        "As main conclusion after this introduction to the current impact of software  in our lives, we can think about what does it mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have seen some examples of business  that have changed due to the use of software. We have new concepts such as cloud computing or cyber physical systems. We have services that have changed our way of communicating. We have wearables, software that is directly impacting in our personal health and what is most important: all software pieces share a lot of commonalities such as a platform to make comments, to rate the quality of a product or service (the like button is an example) or to represent information in a map.\n"

        "**A programming paradigm is a philosophy, style, or general approach to write and execute code.**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different programming paradigms that depend on the way we express the instructions (the programming language) and how they are executed. A common classification divides the programming paradigms in two main styles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Imperative**: the programmer exactly indicates how the machine evolves and changes its state. It is like the extensional definition of a set (Which are the elements of the set?).\n",
        "2.   **Declarative**: the programmer declares which are the properties to process and execute functions, then the computer applies the paradigm to any input. Examples here are functional and logical programming. It is like the intensional definition of a set (which are the properties of the set to become a member?)\n",
        "\n",
        "Later, in this chapter, we will see the notion of programming language. Programming languages are designed to support a programming style, although some languages like **Python** support different types.\n",

        "* Interpreted (an interpreter, a virtual machine). The compiling process will generate some intermediate language (like Bytecode in Java or IL en .NET) that is then executed by an interpreter or virtual machine. In this manner, we add a new layer of abstraction to our programs. It is not necessary to build different versions of a program for the different platforms, but, what it is necessary is an intepreter for each platform. Let's say we separate the execution of the program from the machine.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Procedural programming. The program is modularized in procedures that take as an input some data and return some result. The way we think in programs is in functions that may perform some operation. C, Pascal or even Python can be classified as procedural programming languages.\n",
        "* Object-oriented programming. In this case, we model a problem with objects that have some attributes (data) and methods (operations). When an object is created, it has a state that evolves (object lifetime) depending on the operations that are being executed. Java, C++, C# use this object abstraction to model solutions.\n",
        "* Functional programming. It is similar to procedural programming but it is a kind of computing style in which the functions are formally defined avoiding side-effects. Haskell and Python are examples of this type of language.\n",
        "* Logic programming. There are languages that can be used to model a problem as a set of logic restrictions that are then solved by a reasoner. Prolog is an example of this type of language.\n",
        "* Prototype-oriented programming. Similar to object-oriented programming, here the programming languages define the notion of a class as a prototype that can receive any message for getting an attribute or a method. This prototype is similar to the notion of interface in object-oriented programming. Javascript and Python are examples of this type of programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Datatypes management**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Strong typing. When we declare an element of the program like a variable, a function or a function parameter, we must establish a type (e.g. integer, float, date, etc.). In this manner, the compiler can check whether the program contains type error (usually checking the semantics) and, before, executing the program we already know: 1) the size that the program will initially take in the memory and 2) if the assignments and function invocations are correct. These programming languages are usually more secure than those with duck typing. They prevent some common errors. Java, C++ or C are examples of these programming languages.\n",
        "* Duck typing. The name \"duck\" comes from the this sentence \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\" If we apply this concept to types in a programming language, it means that we can declare elements of the program without indicating the type. The compiler will not detect typing errors, and, only during the execution errors will be detected throwing an exception. The strategy to assign a type are mainly two: 1) type of the value that is assigned for the first time to a variable and 2) each time that a value is assigned, the variable will take the type of that value. The programming languages with duck typing are more prone to errors. Python, Scala or Ruby are examples of this category.\n",
